# 🤵🏻 About me 
Hi, my name is Shi-Tong Peng and I joined Shantou University as an associate professor in 2020. If you are seeking any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to reach out at **shtpeng@stu.edu.cn** (email preferred) or 18018985971 (phone).

My research interests include process monitoring, additive manufacturing, uncertainty quantification, energy/quality management, and life cycle assessment. I have published 30+ papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JWxHJpgAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>  



🎓**Graduate Research Opportunities**  

I am actively seeking **2 motivated Master students** to join my small research group each year. Candidates with backgrounds in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Electronics, or Automation are encouraged to apply.  


- **What I value**:  
  - Strong **self-motivation** and commitment to research.  
  - Outstanding academic performance (**GPA ≥ 3.5** or equivalent).  
  - Solid mathematical foundation (e.g., **>100/150 in postgraduate entrance math exams**).  
  - Interest in **long-term research** (Ph.D. aspirants are particularly welcome!).  

- **What I offer**:  
  - **Collaborative mentorship** focused on deep algorithm development and industrial applications.  
  - **An inclusive environment** — your potential matters more than your undergraduate institution.  
  - **Monthly stipend**.  
  - **Active support for doctoral applications**.
